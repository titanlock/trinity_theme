# trinity_theme

I made a custom version of this theme here: (https://www.xfce-look.org/content/show.php/trinity?content=118906) and (https://www.gnome-look.org/content/show.php/trinity_green?content=140528)

Mostly just made the border color more green the cyan and took the green gtk2 color shceme.
